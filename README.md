>> I wanted to give a shoutout to the research team from Cornell for their research in this area. I reached out to them when I was considering a Nueral Net approach to this problem and they helped answer some questions that I had. You can read their excellent research paper at the above link and check out their model here: https://github.com/DRDRD18/balloons
